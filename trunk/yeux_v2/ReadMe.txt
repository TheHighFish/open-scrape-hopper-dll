    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : yeux_v2 Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this yeux_v2 DLL for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your yeux_v2 application.


yeux_v2.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

yeux_v2.cpp
    This is the main DLL source file.

	When created, this DLL does not export any symbols. As a result, it  
	will not produce a .lib file when it is built. If you wish this project 
	to be a project dependency of some other project, you will either need to 
	add code to export some symbols from the DLL so that an export library 
	will be produced, or you can set the Ignore Input Library property to Yes 
	on the General propert page of the Linker folder in the project's Property 
	Pages dialog box.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
AppWizard has created the following resources:

yeux_v2.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named yeux_v2.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
